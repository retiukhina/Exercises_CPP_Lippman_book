## Exercise 1.3:
Write a program to print Hello, World on the standard output.

## Exercise 1.4:
Our program used the addition operator, +, to add two numbers. Write
a program that uses the multiplication operator, *, to print the product instead.

## Exercise 1.5:
We wrote the output in one large statement. Rewrite the program to use
a separate statement to print each operand.

## Exercise 1.6:
Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
<< " and " << v2;
<< " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How would you fix it?

--> No, it's not a legal code as expressions can't start with operator.

## Exercise 1.11:
Write a program that prompts the user for two integers. Print each number in the range specified by those two integers.
